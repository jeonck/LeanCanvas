# Lean Canvas Generator - Project Context

## Project Overview
The Lean Canvas Generator is a single-page web application that helps users create and organize their business models using the Lean Canvas methodology. The application is built with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, providing a clean, responsive interface for developing business model hypotheses in a structured format.

The Lean Canvas is a one-page business model template that helps entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs design, test, and iterate their business model in a more scientific and measurable way. It's a simplified version of the Business Model Canvas with a focus on startups and lean methodology.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: The application works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatically detects and respects system preference for dark/light mode
- **Auto-resizing Text Areas**: Text inputs automatically adjust their height based on content
- **Copy Functionality**: Users can copy the entire canvas content to clipboard with one click
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to clear all canvas fields
- **Modern UI**: Clean, gradient-based design with animations and intuitive layout

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the entire application structure and JavaScript
- `README.md`: Basic project documentation
- `QWEN.md`: This file providing context for AI interactions

## Technical Details
- Uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling
- Implements modern CSS with gradients, animations, and responsive grid layouts
- JavaScript handles auto-resizing text areas, dark mode detection, copy functionality, and reset functionality
- Built with accessibility in mind (proper semantic HTML, contrast ratios)
- Korean language UI (title says "린 캔버스 생성기" which means "Lean Canvas Generator")

## Sections of the Lean Canvas
1. **Problem** (문제): Top 3 problems of your customer
2. **Solution** (솔루션): Solution to each problem
3. **Unique Value Proposition** (고유한 가치 제안): A memorable phrase that creates a lasting impression
4. **Unfair Advantage** (부당한 이점): What competitors can't easily copy, buy, or replicate
5. **Customer Segments** (고객 세그먼트): Target customers and early adopters
6. **Key Metrics** (핵심 지표): Key activities you're tracking
7. **Channels** (채널): How you reach your customers
8. **Cost Structure** (비용 구조): Fixed and variable costs
9. **Revenue Streams** (수익원): Revenue model, value, and cash flow

## Building and Running
This is a static HTML application that can be run directly in any modern web browser:
1. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser
2. No build process or server required
3. All dependencies (Tailwind CSS) are loaded via CDN
